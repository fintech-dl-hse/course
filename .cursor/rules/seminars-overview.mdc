### Seminars overview (Fintech DL HSE)

#### Expected seminar flow
- Start with quick feedback fixes (from last seminar / forms).
- Short recap of previous material.
- New material (hands-on first, then “how it works”).
- Blitz questions on new concepts.
- Homework overview (what matters, pitfalls, grading hints).

#### Core themes we cover (use as anchors)
- Training basics: backprop, losses, activations, weight init.
- Optimization + regularization: SGD/Adam/Muon, LR schedules, weight decay, dropout.
- CV: CNNs, vision tasks; later ViT + self-supervised/contrastive.
- Generative: AR, GAN, VAE, diffusion.
- NLP: word2vec, tokenization (BPE/WordPiece/SentencePiece), RNN/attention/transformers, pretrained LMs.
- LLM engineering: scaling laws, in-context learning, test-time scaling, PEFT.
- Agents & systems: function calling, agentic patterns, observability, MCP, RAG.
- Multimodal models.

#### Seminar crafting style (lightweight)
- One concept per cell/section; keep cells short and runnable top-to-bottom.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness: explicit names, small helper functions, minimal magic.
- Add type hints + brief docstrings for reusable helpers.
- Make experiments reproducible: fixed seeds, deterministic settings (when feasible), explicit dependencies.
- Before committing notebooks: clear outputs; avoid huge artifacts in repo.
- No trailing spaces.
