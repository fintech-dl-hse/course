### Seminars overview (Fintech DL HSE)

#### Expected seminar flow
- Start with quick feedback fixes (from last seminar / forms).
- Short recap of previous material.
- New material (hands-on first, then “how it works”).
- Blitz questions on new concepts.
- Homework overview (what matters, pitfalls, grading hints).

#### Core themes we cover (use as anchors)
- In each seminar, avoid topics that students have not covered yet; use the plan implied by the list below. For example, do not use CNNs in seminars until the CV block has been covered.
- Training basics: backprop, losses, activations, weight init.
- Optimization + regularization: SGD/Adam/Muon, LR schedules, weight decay, dropout.
- CV: CNNs, vision tasks; later ViT + self-supervised/contrastive.
- Generative: AR, GAN, VAE, diffusion.
- NLP: word2vec, tokenization (BPE/WordPiece/SentencePiece), RNN/attention/transformers, pretrained LMs.
- LLM engineering: scaling laws, in-context learning, test-time scaling, PEFT.
- Agents & systems: function calling, agentic patterns, observability, MCP, RAG.
- Multimodal models.

#### Seminar crafting style (lightweight)
- One concept per cell/section; keep cells short and runnable top-to-bottom.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness: explicit names, small helper functions, minimal magic.
- Add type hints + brief docstrings for reusable helpers.
- Jupyter math: use `$...$` for inline math (not `\(...\)`), and `$$...$$` for display math on separate lines (not `\[...\]`).
- Questions in seminars: one question per separate cell; format as a level-4 heading with ❓ and bold **Вопрос**, e.g. `#### ❓ **Вопрос**: зачем делать Softmax? Ведь на выходе модельки мы уже получаем логиты?`
- Answers on questions: all answers must be hidden by spoilers. Example:
```md
<details>

<summary><strong>Ответ</strong></summary>

Текст ответа</br>
Следующая строчка ответа</br>

</details>
```
- All questions in section `Блиц` must have answers hidden by spoilers. Add them if there is no answer yet.
- Make experiments reproducible: fixed seeds, deterministic settings (when feasible), explicit dependencies.
- Before committing notebooks: clear outputs; avoid huge artifacts in repo.
- Do not run `./seminars/rm_widgets.sh` manually: it is executed automatically.
- No trailing spaces.
- First Cell must be Heading 1 title of seminar (# MLP)
